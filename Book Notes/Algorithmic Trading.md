# Mean Reversion Basics

- Prices, in the most cases, are not stationary. But we could combine two or more instruments that are not mean revertin into a portfolio whosh market value is mean reverting.
- Cointegration. CADF test and Johansen test.
- Time series mean reversion V.S. Cross-sectional mean reversion.
- Hurst exponent
- Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test
- Hurst Exponent and Variance Ratio Test. Get equivalent form in stochastic process and derive half life of mean reversion.
- Half-life of Mean Reversion. Could be used to determine the frequency.
- Cointegrated Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test. Need to know the specific hedge ratio to combine instruments.

- Johansen Test. Test cointegration for more than two instruments.
