When your instrument has a unrealized loss, you could sell it at loss and that amount of loss could be used to compensate the tax of your capital loss and income tax.

- This good because your short-term capital gain is taxed higher than your long term capital gain.
- You income might be taxed higher than the capital gain.
- You save the tax this year and present money is more valuable.



**Regularly clear the profits**

It's not wise to just buy and hold even if you want "buy and hold". Because tax-loss harvest needs your instrument has actual loss instead of reduced gain. Suppose you're holding an ETF position for over 10 years. You probably gonna have over 50% profits. Then, it's almost impossible to have a tax-loss harvest, or the benefit of this is diminished by your accumulated profits.

Instead,  you should clear your unrealized profit regularly. After it becomes the long-term investment, you should close your positions to realize the pnl. Then to avoid wash sale, you could wait 31 days or use an alternative to maintain the exposures.
