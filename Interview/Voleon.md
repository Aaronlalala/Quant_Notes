The interviewer asked questions regarding market microstructure and equity market.

1. What market microstructure knowledge I applied to the strategy?

   My answer: order book distribution, multiple layer of orders, volume based batch value.

2. Do you have any experience relate to equity market?

   1. Since I mentioned the long short strategy on the crypto market with contracts as instruments. He asked how to short in equity markets?
      1. Open a margin account with a brokerage firm.
      2. Use trading platform to place a short sell order and brokerage will locate shares to borrow.
      3. When I decide to close the position, I will place a buy order to buy shares back.
      4. Since I mentioned the sensitivity of the crypto instruments. I mentioned that instruments with lower liquidity is more sensitive to the market sudden moves. He asked how to measure this sensitiity on stock. I said the company's market cap because the smaller company is more volatile. However, his is expected me to answer something related to beta.

3. While market cap does have a role in a company's stock volailiy. A more standardized measure of sensitivity to market movements is the stocks beta. $\beta = \dfrac{Cov(\text{stock return},\text{market return})}{Var(\text{market return})}$. This formula is derived from regression.

4. What strategy to short a company if the researchers told you that their models have a specific confidence that company's stock price gonna drop?

   (left blank for now.)

5. Since I mentioned the long short strategy, he asked what things need to be considered when doing a long short strategy on stocks that pay dividends?

   - The borrowing rate of high dividends stocks are higher, because the lenders will miss dividends. 
   - Stocks also decrease in price as dividends are paid. This could affects the long short positions.

6. Since I mention the duration of the fixed-income when constructing a long short strategy, he asked me knowledge about the what measures the sensitivity of bond?

   **Duration** is a measure of how sensitive the price to changes in interest rates. It provides an estimate of the weighted average time until a bond's cash flows are received. Mathematically, it's the first derivative of the bond price with respect to yield, divided by the price itself. 

   **Convexity** is the second derivative of the bond price with respect to yield, divided by the price. Measures how sensitivity changes over yield.
