- Why there is price difference between crypto spot and future?
  1. Funding rate: assume markets expect price does not change, if funding rate is positive, delivery future could be the long side leg for funding rate arbitrage strategy. Thus, it tends to have higher price than spot.
  2. Price change: if markets expect price goes up, traders prefer opening long position on the delivery future than buying spot.  Because: 1. future has much higher leverage. 2. Use spot as margin to open more future contracts to profit both from spot and future. Thus, in this case, price of future will be higher than price of spot.
