Volume profile is the volume distribution on price levels. It shows the whether investors' opinions of the market are consistent. Price with larger volume is more controversial. Once MA lines cross over that price, it's easy to form a trend.

**Previous Bottom:** the bottom of the market in the last bearish round. Not the one that just ends.

# Chinese CSI 300 Index

## Year 2015

1. Start estimate from previous bottom. Enter market when short term MA breaks the control price.

2. Market goes up 70%. In the mean time, three MA lines are parallel and few volume stacked along the way. Transactions aren't stacked at a certain price. This is clearly a large slope upper trend.![VP2](../Figures/VP2.png)

3. Now market enters a dense transaction area, which means they are lots of investors decide to close their positions. Volume around this price is the first peak after previous bottom. It's your first chance to exit the market.

4. After that, short term MA breaks the "dense price". Market goes up 38%. Three MA lines are parallel again, volume is thin. Clearly, it's another upper trend. However, this time, it's weaker than the last one. From the graph, it looks the same, because we use linear y scale.

5. Then, market enters another dense transaction area, which means another wave of investors decide to exit the markets. And this is the last chance.

6. After reaching the peak, market goes down 11%. Price goes back to earlier dense transaction area. Investors who long this assets at this price earlier start losing. Short term MA line later breaks the "dense price" and crosses mid term MA line. Notice that it did not happen in previous two drops. It's the best chance to prevent loses in the later 40% drops.

7. Then, short term MA breaks the second "dense price" and mid term MA line crosses long term MA line. Three lines are parallel again. A downward trend is formed. It will not end until market enters another dense transaction area.

## Year 2018

1. Again, start estimate from previous bottom. We shall enter the market as short term MA breaks the control price.

2. Market goes up 16% and enters the first dense transaction area. This is the first chance to exit the market and realized that 16% gain in last month.

3. Then price goes up 5%, entering another dense transaction area, which is also the peak.

   ![VP9](../Figures/VP9.png)

4. Market drops 13% and enters the previous dense transaction zone. The current downward trend ends. And this bottom price will be the starting point of next round analysis.

## Prediction of Year 2023

## Year 2018

Current market price of the index is below the control price and the distance between short term MA and control price is still large. However, there are two peaks of this price distribution. As the price fluctuates around like half year earlier, it will sooner take over the previous one. At that time, if the short term MA could breaks this control price easily, market will enter to an upper trend. Combining this with other signals, personally, I have entered 90% position of my portfolio to this market.

# BTC/USDT

1. Similarly, for BTC market. We enter the market as short term MA breaks control price. You might see that short term MA seems to crosses the control price many times. However, if we examine data in a rolling window, it's not true.

2. Market goes up too fast, there is almost no volume accumulated at a specific price range. 8 months -> 500%. There is no dense transaction area, which means market consistenly agree the trend. There is lots of other risk free arbitrage opportunities in such an irrational market. We don't need to take such risks to follow this crazy trend.

3. There is no "dense transaction" area during the trend in BTC market. Whether on the upward trend or the downward trend, investors' views have not diverged greatly. It shows that most of the investors in this market are blindly following the herd, or the market is highly monopolized.

   Volume profile analysis methods would fail in such a market. This is because essentially the method is used to find the price at which investors disagree with each other and make critical decisions.

## Prediction of Year 2023

If we use this method, we should enter the market at Jan of 2023.

<img src="../Figures/VP18.png" alt="image-20230806181324328" style="zoom:33%;" />

Two best priced chips have already been taken and some investors has already realized 30-40% profits. It's not a good idea to enter the market at this price. Personally, I will wait another bearish round.

# S&P500

## Year 2019

The same as S&P index. You got the same chance to enter and also few chances to exit.

![image-20230806182413993](../Figures/VP19.png)

## Prediction of Year 2023

The most recent best chance to enter the market is at May. Now it's gone. You could see that three parallel MA lines. It's risky to follow such high slope upper trend. I would rather wait for the next round.

# Summary

This technical analysis method is only a kind of vageuly correctness. However, it could be programmed to a trading signal and become part of a stacking model.
