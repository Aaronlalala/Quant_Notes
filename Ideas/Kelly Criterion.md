**Life Lesson Learned**

Success and failure are random, though the probabilities are tied to abilities and hardworking. 

Imagine those events outcome in life is like a coin flip with rewards. Even if the game appears fair or even has a positive expectation, if we go all-in every time, we eventually become what described by the kelly criterion. Large expectation does not mean you could get that much in a long term. We might need to work very hard to slightly increase the probability of success, but it's much easier to avoid going all-in with all energy into one thing so that the outcome with high probability would be much better. Also from frequentist statistics view, expectation can be misleading; raising the median and mode should be the goal for most people.

From another perspective, even if you go all-in on something that is guaranteed to bring positive rewards, it could still trap you in a local optimum, which is what epsilon greedy aims to avoid.
