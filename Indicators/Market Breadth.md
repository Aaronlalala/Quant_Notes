**Market Breath**

This indicator is often applied in ETF investing. It helps dtermine if the market movements are supported by a broad base of stocks or just a few large companies.

Given a look back period, the market breadth is the percentage of the instruments above their moving averages.

By convention, we could use 20 days, 50 days and 200 days as our look back periods. 

Another different representation could be A/D line or ratio.
