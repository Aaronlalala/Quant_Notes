# Information Extraction

**Quant’s Priority**

> You probably want to begin your a place where quants are first-class citizens, and are using their brains. I will focus only on hedge funds and prop trading firms.

Well, most people have no choice, people have to trade off among many factors for example, company, career growth, position, etc.

**Company List (props and hf)**

Balyasny, Citadel, Citadel Securities, CTC, DE Shaw, DRW, Element, Exodus Point, Flow Traders, Headlands, Hudson River Trading, Jane Street, Jump Trading, Millennium/WorldQuant, Optiver, PDT, Point72/Cubist, Renaissance Technologies, Susquehanna (SIG), Schonfeld, Squarepoint, Tower, XTX, Two Sigma, Virtu, Voleon, Verition, Walleye, Radix, Five Rings, Old Mission, Maven, etc.

  - No finance book is recommended.

**About Career Choice**

- Always think about the coming job and the job after it to avoid a local optimal.
- Non-alpha related jobs can also be extremely intellectually satisfying. Thinking about data, execution cost improvement, optimization, risks. “The road to hell is paved with mediocre alpha researchers who did not achieve their goals and burned out by the early 30s.”

**Structure Your Life As a Researcher**

- Short but useful advice
  1. You and your research by R. Hamming.
  2. Real-life mathematics by B. Beauzamy.
  3. Ten lessons I wish I had been taught by G.C. Rota.
- Maintain good network. Learn from them, ask for advice, keep in touch, offer help before they have to ask.
- Research Agenda
  1. Write down open questions as they appear and organize in a document.
  2. Search for ArXiv and SSRN.
  3. Read at least a paper a week. Start with the intro, skip the literature review section, go straight to the result statements, and if they are interesting, read proofs and experiments.
  4. If you found an old paper useful, search on Google Scholar the most cited papers that cited that paper.
  5. Every month ask yourself what you have learned the previous month, quarter, and semester, both on the job and in your broader research endeavor. Write those down.

# Thoughts

If I can only take one thing from it, it must be the weekly paper digest habit. It starts slow but could be accumulated to have a powerful result.

It also makes me feel that as a “quant”, not matter what specific job I am doing, I have a huge potential to utilize my off-work time to improve myself. It’s a life long journey.
