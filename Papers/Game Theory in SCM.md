# Static Game Setting

1. All agents simultaneously choose strategies
2. Noncooperative game
3. Complete information: player's strategies are common knowledge
4. One-shot game or extensive form
5. Each player's feasible set of strategies must be independent of the strategies chosen by the other players, i.e., the strategy chosen by one player should not limit the choice of other players. 

## Best Response Functions and Equilibrium

Given n-player game, player i's best response function to the strategies $x_{-i}$ of the other players is the strategy that maximizes player i's payoff.

All players choose their best responses is a candidate for noncooperative solution, and such an outcome is called Nash Equilibrium.

Two problems of Nash Equilibiurm, one is existence and the other is uniqueness.

- Optimal solution (i.e., a solution that maximizes the sum of players' payoffs) need not be an NE.
- NE may not even be Pareto optimal.
